# Shippo API Python wrapper

[![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/shippo.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/shippo)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/goshippo/shippo-python-client.svg?branch=helper-merge-steveByerly-fork-2)](https://travis-ci.org/goshippo/shippo-python-client)

Shippo is a shipping API that connects you with [multiple shipping carriers](https://goshippo.com/carriers/) (such as USPS, UPS, DHL, Canada Post, Australia Post, UberRUSH and many others) through one interface.

Print a shipping label in 10 mins using our default USPS and DHL Express accounts. No need to register for a carrier account to get started.

You will first need to [register for a Shippo account](https://goshippo.com/) to use our API. It's free to sign up, free to use the API. Only pay to print a live label, test labels are free.

### Migrating to V2

#### Configuration

Configurable variables previously available in the main module (ex: `shippo.api_key`) have been moved to the `shippo.config` module.

```python

import shippo

shippo.config.api_key = "<API-KEY>"
shippo.config.api_version = "2018-02-08"
shippo.config.verify_ssl_certs = True
shippo.config.rates_req_timeout = 30.0
```

### How do I get set up?

#### To install from the source file:

```
#!shell
python setup.py install
```

or pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/index.html):

```
#!shell
sudo pip install shippo
```

#### To test:

Set your `SHIPPO_API_KEY` as an environment variable.
e.g. on OSX:

`export SHIPPO_API_KEY="<MY-API-KEY>"`

Run the test with the following command:

```
#!shell
python setup.py test --test-suite=shippo
```

#### Using the API:

```python

import shippo
shippo.config.api_key = "<API-KEY>"

address1 = shippo.Address.create(
    name='John Smith',
    street1='6512 Greene Rd.',
    street2='',
    company='Initech',
    phone='+1 234 346 7333',
    city='Woodridge',
    state='IL',
    zip='60517',
    country='US',
    metadata='Customer ID 123456'
)

print 'Success with Address 1 : %r' % (address1, )

```
